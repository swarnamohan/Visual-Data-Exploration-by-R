# Visual-Data-Exploration-by-R
Using a dataset, from the Federal Election Commission, of the U.S. financial summaries of each U.S. candidate from 2008 to 2002, I’ve created 6 visualizations using R. Making sense of the data from these visualizations, I’ve raised hypotheses about the dataset. The R code of each visualization is written into the document.
